| Name | Explanation     | Reflection and rules from Clean Code|
|---------------|-------------| ---------|
| `calculateHue({ r, g, b }), maxColorValue, colorRange`|Calculates the hue of a color based on which channel (R, G, B) is dominant.|**Do one thing:** The method does one thing only, calculates hue. **Switch statements:** I only use this switch statement once which is correct by the book, but I could have hidden it with polymorphism. **Function arguments:** This method takes way to many arguments, I should have solved that by making the argument into its own class like the requests. |
|`hslToHex({ hue, saturation, lightness }).        `|Converts an HSL color to its HEX representation, handling grayscale and full color ranges.|**Small!:**  This is probably my longest method, and it is too long. It does't really **Do one thing** and could be broken into helper methods .e.g `handleGreyCase`. This method also has too many **Function arguments**|
|`hexToRgb(hexColor)`| Converts a HEX color string to RGB, with validation and error handling. |**Use descriptive names:** I think this method uses good names that makes it easy to follow and understand .e.g `hexWithoutHash`. **Error handling is one thing:** This method does a good job at keeping error handling outside of the method. **Do one thing:** The method only converts, but does this is multiple small steps which should be broken down into its own small methods.|
|`contrastRatio(foreground, background)`|Calculates the WCAG contrast ratio between two colors by computing relative luminance.|**Do one thing:** The method does one thing and keeps clairty. **Function arguments:** Two arguments is okay in some cases according to the book, but I could have kept it down to one by having and object `ColorPair`as parameter.|
|`findAccessibleVariant(request)`|Iteratively tries lighter/darker variants of a base color until one passes WCAG requirements, or throws error.|**Doe one thing:** The main purpose is clear, to find an accessible variant. Though the loop makes it so that it does more than that(loops, calculates, validates, returns and throws) and should be broken down. |
