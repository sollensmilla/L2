| Name | Explanation     | Reflection and rules from Clean Code|
|---------------|-------------| ---------|
|`WcagColorService`| Class name for the main class of the module. |**Use intention-revealing names:** The name makes it clear that the class is a service for WCAG-color operation. `ColorService` would be a simpler and shorter name, but having WCAG in the name makes the intent more clear. |
|`lightenColor`| Public method that lightens a color by a factor. |**Method names:** The name of the method is a verb + an object, which is good. **Avoid disinformation:** It could be named `adjustLighnessUp` to make a clearer connection to the HSL-model, but "lighten" is easier to understand for a user and more **pronounceable**.  |
|`contrastRatio`| Public method that calculates the contrast ratio between two colors. | **Use problem domain names:** "Contrast ratio" is an established concept within WCAG which makes it a clear name. The name is also easy to understand for users who aren´t developers but that work with accessibility. |
|`passesWcag`| Public method that decides wether a color combination passes WCAG guidelines. |**Make meaningful distinctions:** The method revelas what the functionality is, but "passes" as a prefix could be interpreted in different ways(.e.g test, validate, success). An alternative name could be `meetsWcagRequirements` which is longer but more exact to what the method does. |
|`findAccessibleVariant`| Public method that tries to find an accessible variant of a color. | **Don't be cute** & **Use intention-revealing names:** The name is pretty descriptive and not very "cute", though it is worth thinking about if "accesssible" is enough to reveal that it is about color and not other types of accessibility, maybe the name should be `findAccessibleColorVariant`so that it doesn´t need context. |
