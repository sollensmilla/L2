# Reflection on code quality
I think there are some highs and lows in my code for this assignment. Overall, I believe it is fairly easy to read and follow from top to bottom, but it could definitely be written in a much cleaner way once I have learned more. I do not have time to rework it now before the deadline, but even though I have already refactored it multiple times, just writing this reflection has made me notice many improvements that could be made. This is fun, because it means I am learning.

The most challenging part for me was writing the color conversions in a way that would still be easy for the reader to understand, since I had to follow specific formats and structures to make them work as intended. I also want to point out that I did not generate code for any part of the assignment, but for the color conversion to work I had to research online how color conversion functions. However, I still wrote my own code. Looking back, I realize that some of my functions could have been cleaner and smaller, with more meaningful names to improve readability.

I had fun writing the error handling, and I think that part really cleaned up my code nicely. I did still use try-catch blocks, which the book suggested avoiding, but I think it looks good with my fallback messages, and I made them into JavaScript exceptions with my own classes.

The workshop was also a great learning experience, because it forced me to put my thoughts about coding into words when describing and guiding another person. It was also interesting to code based on someone else’s instructions. Finally, the group feedback, when other groups read our code, made me realize even more how important naming and readability are. Even if something makes sense to you while writing it, you have to try to see it from another person’s point of view.
